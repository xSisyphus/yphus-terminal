# yphus-terminal
I am trying to improve myself on the coding. I made a basic terminal app. You can run this code on your own terminal. I don't know if this can work on other OS (I made it on Windows).

When you download this project on your PC, you can write "yphus" in the terminal, and you will see the document.
